# Clustering-NBA-Players

## Description
While watching NBA games, it is not difficult to notice that there seem to be certain types of players. Typically these players may be classified as "3 and D", "role players", "snipers/sharpshooters" and more. I wanted to see what statistics said about players, how they are similar, and if we can cluster them in this way.
